# AfriMove Project - Documentation and Code
AfriMove is an open, bottom-up project joined by research centres and environmental institutes to promote collaborative science based on knowledge and data sharing to investigate the movement ecology of African wildlife in a variety of habitats and under different management regimes.  
In these pages you can find the database documentation, the most relevant SQL code and part of the code used for analysis.
